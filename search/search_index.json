It is a simple swap interface, just select the two tokens you wish to exchange. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers (\"LPs\") who stake their tokens in \"Pools\". In exchange, they get LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, which can also be staked to earn TRI tokens in the \"farms\". When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a 0.3% trading fee, which is broken down as follows: - 0.25% - Paid to liquidity pools in the form of a trading fee for liquidity providers. - 0.05% - Sent to TRI token farm.

Liquidity Pools \u00b6 Trisolaris charges 0.3% fee for all trades, of which 0.25% is added to the liquidity pool of the token pair that was traded on. A liquidity pool (LP) is a pool of two tokens, e.g. NEAR and TRI tokens. This pool is what allows users to exchange between the two tokens automatically. Users can earn a share of the trading fees by depositing a pair of tokens into the LP (also known as \"adding liquidity\"). Users will receive an LP token, representing their share of the LP. Risks and Rewards \u00b6 By adding liquidity you'll earn 0.25% of all trades on this pair proportional to your share of the pool. Fees are added to the pool, accrue in real time and can be claimed by withdrawing your liquidity. Your share of the Trading Fees will be accrued in real time and will be paid on top of your existing position when you exit the Liquidity Pool Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss (IL). If the prices of the two tokens revert back to the same prices when you added liquidity, you won't suffer any IL. How to add Liquidity to a Pool? \u00b6 Grab your tokens and head to the Pools page.

This user guide will provide an overview of how to use Trisolaris. Set up Metamask with Aurora mainnet \u00b6 Installing Metamask \u00b6 If you have not installed and own a Metamask wallet, please do so here . It is compatible with Chrome, Brave and Firefox. Connect Metamask to Aurora \u00b6 Unlock Metamask > Select Settings > Select Add Network. Enter the following Aurora information: Network Name: Aurora Mainnet New RPC URL: https://mainnet.aurora.dev ChainID: 1313161554 Symbol: AETH Explorer: https://explorer.aurora.dev/ Gas fees on Aurora will be paid in ETH, making users from Ethereum feel at home. Set up a NEAR Wallet \u00b6 How to create a NEAR web wallet \u00b6 Near wallet is your gateway to send NEAR from a CEX (centralized exchange) to another wallet which is connected to Aurora network. This guide will show you how to create your own Near wallet. If you already have one, skip this part. Go to wallet.near.org. Choose \u201cCreate Account\u201d This is the place where you can choose your own name account, try to make a good one since you can not change that name after you finish. Some rules that you should follow: Note: This will also be your wallet address, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to Ethereum, NEAR uses human-readable account names as wallet addresses. Your account ID can contain any of the following: Lowercase characters (a-z)\uff5cDigits (0\u20139)\uff5cCharacters (_-) can be used as separators Your account ID CANNOT contain: Characters \u201c@\u201d or \u201c.\u201d\uff5cFewer than 2 characters\uff5cMore than 64 characters (including .near) Choosing your security method. This one is important as you need to choose your secured method. Luckily, you can change this after you create an account, but right now you should select the most secure (i.e: Recovery Phrase or Ledger Nano S or X). You can add two other methods after you finish creating an account. Now your screen will present twelve characters and you have to back up this phrase. You can do the following action to backup: Write down several pieces of paper and put them somewhere else safe. Save it into some files on another computer or phone which you only use for security purposes (remember to clean all the virus before putting the seed phrase into it). Make sure you get your seed phrase secure and then you enter one of the random keywords (in this situation is word number 5) to verify that phrase. Now you'll need to verify your new account, there are 2 ways to do this: One-time passcode: Verify your account by confirming the passcode sent via email or phone SMS. Initial Deposit: Verify your account by making your first deposit.

If you're farming with NEAR-USDT, for example, you can gain more NEAR-USDT. It's attractive because the yields can appear big, but it minimizes your TRI tokens. This means that you miss out on profits if TRI tokens increase price. Instead, you may stake your TRI tokens to xTRI, which has no impermanent loss (IL), and maximizes your profits when TRI tokens go up. How does it work? \u00b6 xTRI is the main staking mechanism on the Trisolaris Protocol. When you stake your TRI, you effectively exchange your TRI for xTRI. Over time, you\u2019ll always earn more TRI by holding xTRI tokens. This is because every swap on Trisolaris, a 0.05% fee is charged and sent to the xTRI pool. This fee is used to buy back TRI tokens periodically (currently, buy-backs happen every 1 days). So when you exchange your xTRI for TRI, you'll get more TRI than what you started with. Why stake? \u00b6 No Impermanent Loss Maximize your profits when TRI tokens go up A 0.05% trading fee is used to periodically buy back TRI tokens. When you exchange your xTRI for TRI, you'll receive more TRI than you started with.
