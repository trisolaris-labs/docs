Choose \u201cCreate Account\u201d This is the place where you can choose your own name account, try to make a good one since you can not change that name after you finish. Some rules that you should follow: Note: This will also be your wallet address, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to Ethereum, NEAR uses human-readable account names as wallet addresses. Your account ID can contain any of the following: Lowercase characters (a-z)\uff5cDigits (0\u20139)\uff5cCharacters (_-) can be used as separators Your account ID CANNOT contain: Characters \u201c@\u201d or \u201c.\u201d\uff5cFewer than 2 characters\uff5cMore than 64 characters (including .near) Choosing your security method. This one is important as you need to choose your secured method. Luckily, you can change this after you create an account, but right now you should select the most secure (i.e: Recovery Phrase or Ledger Nano S or X). You can add two other methods after you finish creating an account. Now your screen will present twelve characters and you have to back up this phrase. You can do the following action to backup: Write down several pieces of paper and put them somewhere else safe. Save it into some files on another computer or phone which you only use for security purposes (remember to clean all the virus before putting the seed phrase into it). Make sure you get your seed phrase secure and then you enter one of the random keywords (in this situation is word number 5) to verify that phrase. Now you'll need to verify your new account, there are 2 ways to do this: One-time passcode: Verify your account by confirming the passcode sent via email or phone SMS. Initial Deposit: Verify your account by making your first deposit. This can be done by depositing from an existing account, purchasing with a Credit Card (via Moonpay) or by making a manual deposit from CEXs. You're all done!

This fee % as well as where they flow to can both be adjusted in the future via governance by $TRI token holders. TRI Distribution \u00b6 Token Contract : 0xFa94348467f64D5A457F75F8bc40495D33c65aBB Total Supply : 500,000,000 Months to emit : 36 Allocation: \u00b6 70% Community + Liquidity Incentives 15% Treasury : For future strategic partnerships, investors, and more 15% Current & Future Team : 4 month lockup, followed by 12 month vesting. See full details here Emissions \u00b6 As we move forward, over the course of 3 years, we aim to systematically reduce the rate of emissions across our liquidity mining programs. The first of these gradual reductions in emissions will begin in February 2022. Here is a chart that provides a full view of the overall TRI supply distribution and how it comes into circulation: Brief overview of the different segments above: Farming Rewards : The current and future emissions across all liquidity mining farms on Trisolaris. Team/Advisors : Vesting TRI tokens allocated for the team and advisors. More info around our plan with these tokens here . Marketing & Community : This is a general category that encompasses TRI held in the treasury at the moment that will be used over time for additional community incentives (such as our recently announced retroactive airdrop ). Future Strategic Investors : This is a portion of the token treasury that is an allocation held out for future strategic investors . It means that in the case that Trisolaris were to raise investor funds in the future (to scale up the team or grow the project further), these would be the tokens allocated for them. These would be vesting over time.

Here is a chart that provides a full view of the overall TRI supply distribution and how it comes into circulation: Brief overview of the different segments above: Farming Rewards : The current and future emissions across all liquidity mining farms on Trisolaris. Team/Advisors : Vesting TRI tokens allocated for the team and advisors. More info around our plan with these tokens here . Marketing & Community : This is a general category that encompasses TRI held in the treasury at the moment that will be used over time for additional community incentives (such as our recently announced retroactive airdrop ). Future Strategic Investors : This is a portion of the token treasury that is an allocation held out for future strategic investors . It means that in the case that Trisolaris were to raise investor funds in the future (to scale up the team or grow the project further), these would be the tokens allocated for them. These would be vesting over time.","title":"Emissions"},{"location":"tokenomics/#emissions-schedule-by-month","text":"Month TRI Per Block Nov 2021 5 Dec 2021 5 Jan 2022 5 Feb 2022 4.75 Mar 2022 4.75 Apr 2022 4.5 May 2022 4.5 Jun 2022 4 Jul 2022 4 Aug 2022 3.75 Sep 2022 3.75 Oct 2022 3.75 Nov 2022 3.75 Dec 2022 3.5 Jan 2023 3.5 Feb 2023 3.5 Mar 2023 3.5 Apr 2023 3.25 May 2023 3.25 Jun 2023 3.25 Jul 2023 3.25 Aug 2023 3 Sep 2023 3 Oct 2023 3 Nov 2023 3 Dec 2023 3 Jan 2024 3 Feb 2024 2.75 Mar 2024 2.75 Apr 2024 2.75 May 2024 2.75 Jun 2024 2.75 Jul 2024 2.75 Aug 2024 2.5 Sep 2024 2.5 Oct 2024 2.5 Nov 2024 2.5","title":"Emissions Schedule By Month:"},{"location":"tokenomics/#incentivized-pools","text":"Liquidity providers who stake their LP tokens from the following pools in the Farms page will be rewarded with $TRI from the 70% Liquidity Incentives allocation.
