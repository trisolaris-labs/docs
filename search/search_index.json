In exchange, they get LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, which can also be staked to earn TRI tokens in the \"farms\". When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a 0.3% trading fee, which is broken down as follows: - 0.25% - Paid to liquidity pools in the form of a trading fee for liquidity providers. - 0.05% - Sent to TRI token farm.

Liquidity Pools \u00b6 Trisolaris charges 0.3% fee for all trades, of which 0.25% is added to the liquidity pool of the token pair that was traded on. A liquidity pool (LP) is a pool of two tokens, e.g. NEAR and TRI tokens. This pool is what allows users to exchange between the two tokens automatically. Users can earn a share of the trading fees by depositing a pair of tokens into the LP (also known as \"adding liquidity\"). Users will receive an LP token, representing their share of the LP. Risks and Rewards \u00b6 By adding liquidity you'll earn 0.25% of all trades on this pair proportional to your share of the pool. Fees are added to the pool, accrue in real time and can be claimed by withdrawing your liquidity. Your share of the Trading Fees will be accrued in real time and will be paid on top of your existing position when you exit the Liquidity Pool Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss (IL). If the prices of the two tokens revert back to the same prices when you added liquidity, you won't suffer any IL. How to add Liquidity to a Pool? \u00b6 Grab your tokens and head to the Pools page.

If you're farming with NEAR-USDT, for example, you can gain more NEAR-USDT. It's attractive because the yields can appear big, but it minimizes your TRI tokens. This means that you miss out on profits if TRI tokens increase price. Instead, you may stake your TRI tokens to xTRI, which has no impermanent loss (IL), and maximizes your profits when TRI tokens go up. How does it work? \u00b6 xTRI is the main staking mechanism on the Trisolaris Protocol. When you stake your TRI, you effectively exchange your TRI for xTRI. Over time, you\u2019ll always earn more TRI by holding xTRI tokens. This is because every swap on Trisolaris, a 0.05% fee is charged and sent to the xTRI pool. This fee is used to buy back TRI tokens periodically (currently, buy-backs happen every 1 days). So when you exchange your xTRI for TRI, you'll get more TRI than what you started with.
