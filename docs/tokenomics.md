# General Info

# Emissions

As we move forward, over the course of 3 years, we aim to systematically reduce the rate of emissions across our liquidity mining programs. The first of these gradual reductions in emissions will begin in February 2022.

Here is a chart that provides a full view of the overall TRI supply distribution and how it comes into circulation:

Brief overview of the different segments above:

- **Farming Rewards**: The current and future emissions across all liquidity mining farms on Trisolaris.
- **Team/Advisors**: Vesting TRI tokens allocated for the team and advisors. More info around our plan with these tokens [here](https://medium.com/trisolaris-labs/update-team-advisors-token-vesting-9ced4bc72aee).
- **Marketing & Community**: This is a general category that encompasses TRI held in the treasury at the moment that will be used over time for additional community incentives (such as our [recently announced retroactive airdrop](https://medium.com/trisolaris-labs/merry-christmas-from-trisolaris-29671fda22af)).
- **Future Strategic Investors**: This is a portion of the token treasury that is an allocation held out for future strategic investors*.* It means that in the case that Trisolaris were to raise investor funds in the future (to scale up the team or grow the project further), these would be the tokens allocated for them. These would be vesting over time.
