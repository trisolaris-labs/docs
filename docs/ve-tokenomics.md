## Vote locking and reward boosting

> To encourage participation in the DAO and benefit the protocol long term, a voting escrow mechanism will be introduced.

- Users will be able to lock their TRI or xTRI for different time periods in exchange for vexTRI.

> (We want to enable locking of xTRI instead of TRI, but are still exploring feasibility and implications)

- Users with vexTRI will decide which pools get included for liquidity mining, how much rewards to allocate per pool, fee % changes on the platform products and approve project partner proposals.
- This vexTRI will also give the user more weight when collecting certain farming rewards (effectively a boosted farm reward for the vexTRI holder).
- This means that vexTRI holders will naturally gain more yields over time as proportionally more boosted rewards along with underlying fee + staking yield are accrued to them.
- Since vexTRI is locked xTRI (potentially), vexTRI holders will continue to accrue more TRI from single-sided-staking.
