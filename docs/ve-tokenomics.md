## Vote locking and reward boosting

> To encourage participation in the DAO and benefit the protocol long term, a voting escrow mechanism will be introduced.

- Users will be able to lock their TRI or xTRI for different time periods in exchange for vexTRI.

> (We want to enable locking of xTRI instead of TRI, but are still exploring feasibility and implications)

- Users with vexTRI will decide which pools get included for liquidity mining, how much rewards to allocate per pool, fee % changes on the platform products and approve project partner proposals.
- This vexTRI will also give the user more weight when collecting certain farming rewards (effectively a boosted farm reward for the vexTRI holder).
- This means that vexTRI holders will naturally gain more yields over time as proportionally more boosted rewards along with underlying fee + staking yield are accrued to them.
- Since vexTRI is locked xTRI (potentially), vexTRI holders will continue to accrue more TRI from single-sided-staking.

## Bribes and Gauges

Gauges are how vexTRI holders can vote and direct stable swap fees to their preferred pools.

Token bribes incentivize vexTRI holders to vote on specific gauges whilst gaining extra rewards.

> Bribes can only be in the form of TRI tokens.
