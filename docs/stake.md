# Staking

## Stake your TRI to pTRI to earn 0.05% of protocol revenue in the form of stablecoin LP tokens!

All revenue collected by Trisolaris DEX will be converted into USN, USDT & USDC, these stables will then be added to the existing 3pool to get LP tokens back, and eventually will be distributed to stakers based on their proportion in the staking pool! Users will have a choice to claim them, or claim + auto-stake into the 3pool farm!
